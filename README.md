# JavascriptBasics
There are 5 types of datatypes.
1.Numbers

JS treats integers, fractions and negative nos. all as numbers.Doesn't have a separate datatype like other languages.
If you type any no. in console , it spits back the no.
We can perfrorm basic operations like addition ,s ubtraction , modulus in the JS console.

2.Strings

They are defined by writing in single or double quotes.
If you type any string(in quotes) in console , it spits back the string.
we can concatenate the strings too
    eg."hi"+"anshika"
          hianshika
To use "" in the text itself without confusing the console , add a backslach(\) before the quotes.
        eg."I said \"go\"."
        I said "go".
To use \ in the text itself without confusing the console , add a backslach(\) before the \.
        eg."hi\\"
        hi\
.length
    to find the no. of characters in the string.
        eg. "hello".length // 5
        eg. "my name is anshika".length // 18
Accesing individual characters using square brackets.
        eg."hello"[0] // h
